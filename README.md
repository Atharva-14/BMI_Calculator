# BMI Calculator 📱 📏 ✔️ ⛔️ ⚠️

## Project Idea 💡 🌟

This project consist on creating an Android App that calculates BMI ( Body Mass Index ) & then report its status with some advices to the user ...

This idea exists already but as a beginner in kotlin I thought that it might be a good idea to start with.

In this project I tried to simplify all the process using the most simple formula & dividing the BMI state into just 3 categories...

 * BMI Formulat  : bmi= weight (kg) / ( height^2 (m))
 
 * BMI Categories:
 
   * Low    : bmi  < 18.5 
   * Normal : 18.4 < bmi < 25.1
   * High   : bmi  > 25
